# BookHub-Web-Project
Added to Github on 6/19/2020 By David Rotger
Project I am working on during the global pandemic due to the novel coronavirus COVID-19, the goal is to create a hub for books 
that can be searched by a user and added to a list of favorites and make recommendations about other books in the same genre, 
by the same author, etc. Eventually exapand the interactivity and features that can be used by different communities of book lovers, 
like a social media platform for books. Currently using the Google Books REST API with Javascript and html/CSS for the front end 
user experience aspect of web application.
